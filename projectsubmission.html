  <h1 align="center">PROJECT SHOWCASE</h1>
  <h3>WHATS THIS FOR?</h3>

  <p>
    Welcome to the <b>PesterFest</b> Project Showcase! This is a spotlight segment for cool work made by the community!
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’ve made something you’re proud of (finished or still in progress), this is your chance to share it in a way that feels
    organized and easy for attendees to discover.
  </p>

  <h3 id="important">IMPORTANT LIMITS (PLEASE READ)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>At most, 30 total projects will be accepted.</b></li>
    <li><b>We will close this form on March 20th OR once we get 100 responses.</b></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We’re keeping the lineup tight so every accepted project actually gets seen. If the form closes early, that’s why.
  </p>

  <h3 id="how">HOW IT WORKS</h3>

  <ul>
    <p>
      <b>
        The gist: you submit a project, we review it, and then we feature accepted projects during the convention
        in a dedicated showcase space.
      </b>
    </p>
    <li>
      <b>1) Submit your project:</b> title, short description, credits, and a link or media.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>2) We review + build the showcase:</b> we’ll confirm you’re in (or follow up with questions if needed).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>3) You get featured:</b> accepted projects appear in the showcase with clear info so attendees can actually engage.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <b>Keep in mind:</b> A clear description goes a long way. Tell people what it is, who it’s for, and what you want them to do next.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h3 id="what">WHAT YOU CAN SUBMIT</h3>
  <p>
    We’re open to a wide range of projects—as long as it’s something you made (or helped make) and you’re comfortable sharing it publicly.

  </ul>
