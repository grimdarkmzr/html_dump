  <h3>WHATS THIS FOR?</h3>

  <p>
    Welcome to the behind-the-scenes crew for <b>PesterFest</b>! If you’ve ever watched an online event and thought,
    “I want to help make that,” this is your sign.
  </p>

  <p>
    We’re building a convention that feels <b>fun and welcoming</b>. That takes people who can jump in, communicate,
    and follow through whether you’re here for one small task or you want to be part of the core team.
  </p>

  <h3 id="how">HOW IT WORKS</h3>

  <ul>
    <p>
      <b>
        The gist: you pick a role, we get you set up, and you help make the convention better for everyone.
      </b>
    </p>
    <li>
      <b>1) Pick your lane:</b> moderation, etc, etc
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>2) Get on board:</b> we’ll share tools and a clear first task so you’re not guessing what to do.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>3) Participate:</b> check in, ask questions early, and ship small improvements that add up fast.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <b>Pro-tip:</b> Tell us what you actually enjoy doing. “I’m good at moderating servers” and “I love making checklists”
    are both extremely valuable skills around here.
  </p>

  <h3 id="expectations">EXPECTATIONS (KEEP IT SIMPLE)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Be kind, be clear.</b> We’re all working together. Assume good intent, ask questions early, and keep it constructive.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Do what you claim.</b> If you take a task, follow through—or tell us quickly if life happens.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Keep it PG-13.</b> Public-facing spaces should be friendly and appropriate for a wide audience.
