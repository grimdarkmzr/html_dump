    <h1 align="center">VIRTUAL COSPLAY CONTEST</h1>
    <h3>OKAY. WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?</h3>

    <p>
        Welcome to <b>PesterFest's Cosplay Contest</b>! This is an online-friendly and for-fun cosplay competition for fans who
        want to show off their work and have fun!
    </p>

    <p>
        You’ll submit your entry online, showcase to our judges privately, and then
        you’ll be shown on the virtual stage during the livestream showcase!
    </p>

    <h3 id="how">HOW IT WORKS </h3>

    <ul>
        <p> <b>The rules are simple: you submit a cosplay (video reccomended), which will then be publicly voted for by our community as well as the organizers. Two winners will be selected by each of these groups, and they will receive a special role in the server!</b> </p>
        <li>
            <b>1) We pre-judge on video:</b> you show your costume, talk about what you made/modified!
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>2) You hit the virtual stage:</b> showcase your costume, then awards!
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <b>Pro-tip:</b> If you’re proud of a specific detail (paintwork, embroidery, armor seams, wig styling, prop finish), mention it!
        We'd love to see what you put effort into!
    </p>
